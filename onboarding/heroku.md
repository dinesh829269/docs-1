## Onboarding Heroku

Heroku is a platform as a service. We use it to host MiddCourses.

### Create an account

You need a Heroku account to collaborate on MiddCourses.
[Sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) for one if you don't already have one.

### Enable Two-factor Authentication

From your [account page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account), click
**Setup Two-factor Authentication...** and follow the prompts.

Two-factor authentication (often called 2FA) provides a second level of security
should your password be compromised.
