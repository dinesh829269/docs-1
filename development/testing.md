## Testing

New code should have tests to verify it works as expected.

Write tests for old, previously untested, code as you are able.

If you uncover and fix a bug, write tests to ensure it stays fixed.

### Testing Resources

* [Testing in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/):
  Most of your tests will be written in Python and use Django's test framework.
  This is a good starting place.
