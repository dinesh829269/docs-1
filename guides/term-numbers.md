## Middlebury Term Numbers

Example: `201690` is "Fall 2016"

A term number can be broken down into three parts:

 - `2016`: The year the term started
 - `9`: The month the term started
 - `0`: How far into the month the term started
 
Given a year (ex. `2016`) the two digit term codes are:

| Name   | Code |
| -------|------|
| Fall   | 90   |
| Winter | 10   |
| Spring | 20   |
| Summer | 65   |
